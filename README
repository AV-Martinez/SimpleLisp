A simple, well documented Lisp interpreter written in C++.

Follows as much as possible the Common Lisp standard as specified in:

	Common Lisp the Language, 2nd Edition
	Guy L. Steele
	https://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/cltl2.html

This is experimental and educational code, no major Lisp applications are expected to be built 
using this interpreter. Code cleaness is prefered to code efficiency. Features that would 
lead to becoming more compliant to the CL standard or facilitate the creation of large 
Lisp applications at the expense of making the code more complex are disregarded.

The supported types are Symbol (character string with no blanks), Number(long integer) and
Cons (list).
